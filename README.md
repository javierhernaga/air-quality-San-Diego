# Analysis of Air-Quality in San Diego Metropolitan Area

#### This project analyzes the air quality in the metropolitan area of San Diego and compares it with the city's population growth and the number of registered vehicles since 2020. By examining these factors together, the project aims to identify potential correlations and trends that could impact the city's environment and public health.


### Objectives

The main objectives of this project are:

- Analyze Air Quality Trends: Assess historical air quality data to detect patterns or significant changes in pollution levels.
- Correlate with Population Growth: Understand how the increasing population in San Diego has influenced air quality.
- Impact of Vehicle Registration: Evaluate the relationship between the number of vehicles and air quality, considering traffic congestion and emissions.


### Methodology

The analysis is conducted using Python and several data science libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, and Matplotlib. The workflow involves:

1. Data Collection: Gathering air quality, population, and vehicle registration datasets.
2. Data Cleaning & Preprocessing: Standardizing and preparing data for analysis.
3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Visualizing and examining trends in air quality, population growth, and vehicle numbers.
4. Statistical Analysis: Correlating and modeling the relationships between variables to identify significant patterns.
